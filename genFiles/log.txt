There are in fact two types of spidermen: jumping spider people, and brown recluse spider people. Of course, jumping spider men aren't venomous. Which is odd, as jumping spiders are.

Better not tell you now.

It was one steep bill, but it was worth it.
I had to burn it down. The burden of hospitality was too great.

After a while I got fed up and threw my coins at him. The silver coins hit him in the body and shattered his upper spine. I sat there watching him slowly suffocate.

I’m monkey food if I don’t leave!
I hope she likes me...

I sometimes regret letting various folk of any kind live. Usually I spare them out of a sense of laziness, and I feel later like my professional integrity has been somehow damaged.

I know too much and the cult still lives.
In strange aeons even death may die.
Without a nervous system, all it can feel is anger.
Nevermore.
I'm out of new songs.
My home was not merely a madhouse designed by a madman, but a madhouse designed by many madmen, each with an intense hatred for the previous madman's unique flavour of madness.
Everyone will vote for themselves out of mistrust for anyone else, and some kind of weird direct democracy coalition will need to be formed from 11 million or so individuals. 
I feel like a doormat, could this be love?
Never fight a carp.
I make small talk about the weather and they tell me to go kill a bronze colossus. Thanks, mead hall patrons.

It was all inevitable.
I didn't even know they had magazines like that.
I think nothing new can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace. 
Finally, something to encourage the raised corpses to join in with the festivities.
Without mystery life is rather bland, hm?
I no longer have any regrets. I've reached my peak. I can now retire as quizmaster.
